# Zenvest - Parametric Income Protection for Delivery Partners
Zenvest is a web-based micro-insurance platform providing **instant, trigger-based payouts** for India’s gig workforce.

It replaces manual claims with **automated environmental triggers** (weather, AQI, downtime) so delivery partners aren’t penalized for factors beyond their control.

## Core Enrollment → Claim Workflow

<img width="1024" height="1536" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ee11107-1f55-4721-9230-b4ae2f06f81f" />

## Weekly Premium Model

### Fixed Plan Tiers

| Plan | Weekly Premium | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **Starter Shield** | ₹99/week | Basic coverage for low-risk days |
| 🔵 **Smart Shield** | ₹149/week | Balanced coverage at medium pricing |
| 🟣 **Pro Shield** | ₹249/week | Highest coverage with best benefits |

### How AI Recommends a Plan

The AI risk profiler runs at onboarding and each Sunday to recommend the right tier based on:

| Signal | Source |
|---|---|
| Geographic zone risk | GPS + historical claim density |
| 7-day weather forecast | LSTM weather model |
| Delivery platform activity hours | Swiggy / Zomato APIs |
| AQI forecast | CPCB API |
| Worker's claim history & trust score | Internal DB |

Workers receive a weekly recommendation and can freely switch plans at each Sunday renewal -no lock-in.

---

## Parametric Triggers (Auto-Payouts)

Payouts are triggered automatically when thresholds are met:

- **Rainfall** → >25mm in 3 hours (IMD API)  
- **Air Quality** → AQI >400 for 4+ hours (CPCB)  
- **System Outage** → App downtime >2 hours  
- **Extreme Heat** → >45°C for 6 hours  

---

## AI/ML Integration

### 1. Identity Verification
OCR extracts Aadhaar details; liveness detection CNN prevents photo spoofing; deepfake classifier catches AI-generated video fraud.

### 2. Risk Profiling (XGBoost)
Scores each delivery partner at onboarding as Low / Medium / High risk. Updates weekly via Bayesian inference using new claim data. Features: delivery zone, weekly hours, platform, tenure, prior claims, city, season.

### 3. Plan Recommendation
XGBoost risk score + LSTM weather forecast + zone loss ratio combined to recommend the best plan tier each Sunday.

### 4. Predictive Disruption (LSTM)
Trained on IMD rainfall, CPCB AQI, and platform downtime logs. Forecasts disruption probability 6 hours ahead by zone.

### 5. Fraud Detection (Isolation Forest)
Detects GPS spoofing, sudden inactivity before trigger events, and duplicate accounts. Flagged claims go to human review; clean claims auto-approve.

### 6. Plan Explainer Chatbot (LLM)
GPT-4o powered chatbot answers plan questions and guides onboarding in Hindi and English.

### 7. Churn Predictor
Flags workers likely to lapse; triggers a retention nudge or discount offer via SMS/email.

### 8. NLP Sentiment (Post-Payout)
Worker rates experience post-payout. Sentiment model updates their trust score and feeds the weekly model retrain.

# Adversarial Defense & Anti-Spoofing Strategy

## 1. Problem Statement
Current verification relies on a single-point failure: **GPS Coordinates**.

A coordinated group of 500+ actors is bypassing this using:
- Mock location providers  
- Rooted device overlays  

This triggers false payouts.

We must shift from **"Location Validation" → "Environment Validation"**

---

## 1. The Differentiation

We don’t rely only on GPS. Instead, we check **device behavior + real-world signals** to confirm if a delivery partner is genuinely stranded.

- Real users show:
  - Natural phone movement  
  - Changing network signals  
  - Consistent past routes  

- Fake/spoofed users show:
  - No movement (static device/emulator)  
  - Same IP/VPN usage  
  - Sudden location jumps  

 By combining these signals, the system creates a **“proof of presence”** before approving payouts.

---

## 2. The Data

Beyond GPS, we analyze multiple data points to detect fraud (especially coordinated attacks):

- **Motion Data (Accelerometer/Gyroscope)**  
  → Checks if the phone is actually being used  

- **Battery & Power State**  
  → Real usage vs always charging setups  

- **Network Information**  
  → IP type, VPN/proxy detection, signal changes  

- **Historical Behavior**  
  → Normal routes vs sudden “teleporting”  

- **Cluster Patterns**  
  → Multiple users claiming from the same spot at the same time  

- **Weather & AQI Data**  
  → Verifies if conditions actually match the claim  

This helps identify not just single frauds, but **fraud rings**.

---

## 3. The UX Balance

We ensure fraud checks don’t hurt genuine users.

###  Low Risk
- Instant payout  
- No interruption  

---

###  Medium Risk
- Quick verification:
  - Rotate phone  
  - Short video check  

 Takes a few seconds, minimal friction  

---

### High Risk
- Sent for manual review  
- Message shown: *“Verification in progress”*  

 No instant rejection, avoids unfair penalties
